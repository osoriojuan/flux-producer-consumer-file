Dear Friend,
I hope you're doing well! I've been thinking about you a lot lately and how much I miss you. I can't wait to see you again and catch up on everything that's been going on in your life.
I've been keeping busy lately with work and spending time with friends, but I always think about you and how much fun we used to have together. I really hope we can get together soon so we can pick up where we left off.
I hope to hear from you soon!
Love,
Your friend
